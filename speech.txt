Do I wish that the Christian would become Hindu? God forbid. Do I wish that 
the Hindu or Buddhist would become Christian? God forbid. The seed is put in
 the ground, and earth and air and water are placed around it. Does the seed
 become the earth, or the air, or the water? No. It becomes a plant, it 
develops after the law of its own growth, assimilates the air, the earth, and
 the water,converts them into plant substance, and grows into a plant. Similar
 is the case with religion. The Christian is not to become a Hindu or a Buddhist,
 nor a Hindu or a Buddhist to become a Christian. But each must assimilate the 
spirit of the others and yet preserve his individuality and grow according to 
his own law of growth.
